== Description ==
Twosides is exactly that: a plugin that list your opinions or views on two separate sides of the page according to the positive or negative ideology of the comment. 
Call them anything you like but for lack of spending all day to create this monster we call them Opinions. Twosides has a few requirements but that is part of what helps to make it unique.

The basic premise is for a blog to contain a subject matter in a single post which, can instill a wave of comments that are split into two groups as responses to the single post. Pro/Con, Conservative/Progressive, Beatles/Rolling Stones, Mom/Dad, Product opinions, Positive/Negative Reviews.... endless possibilities.

1. You must make changes, or replace, your comments template in your WordPress theme.
2. Reccommend that you use a child-theme when setting up the comments form. 
3. Your blog will be only allowed to use the Twosides commenting system.
4. If you need a standard blog with standard comments you may want to install a second instance of WordPress onto a sub-domain and link from your parent site. (blog.mywebsite.com)
5. Admins can not post a comment to the front end, public side, while logged in.

There are full instructions inside of the Admin panel once you install the plugin. 
== Features ==
