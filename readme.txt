Split comments into two types of groups. 

== Description ==
List your comments as opinions or views on two separate sides of the page. Twosides is exactly that: a plugin that list your opinions or views on two separate sides of the page according to the positive or negative ideology of the comment. 
The basic premise is for a blog to contain a subject matter in a single post which, can instill a wave of comments that are split into two groups as responses to the single post. Pro/Con, Conservative/Progressive, Beatles/Rolling Stones, Mom/Dad, Product opinions, Positive/Negative Reviews.... endless possibilities.
